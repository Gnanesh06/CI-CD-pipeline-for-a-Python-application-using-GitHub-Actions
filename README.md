In this project, we implemented a Continuous 
Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a 
Python application using GitHub Actions. CI/CD automation 
facilitates efficient building, testing, and deployment of 
software applications, enhancing development workflows 
and overall project management.
