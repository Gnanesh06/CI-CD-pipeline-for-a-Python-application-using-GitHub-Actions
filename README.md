In this project, we implemented a Continuous 
Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a 
Python application using GitHub Actions. CI/CD automation 
facilitates efficient building, testing, and deployment of 
software applications, enhancing development workflows 
and overall project management.The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate the 
automation of building, testing, and deploying a Python 
application using GitHub Actions. The application, a simple 
Flask-based web service displaying a "Hello, World!" 
message, was containerized using Docker for streamlined 
deployment.
